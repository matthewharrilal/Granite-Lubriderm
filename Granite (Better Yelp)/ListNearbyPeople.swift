        // So essentially what made our code work was that because as oppose to the cell for row at function we are essentially setting the data here as oppose to in the cell for row we are only displaying the username of the user in the corresponding cell in the row and in addtion to that in the prepare for segue as we know we use that function when we want to pass data from one view controller to another therefore in combination of those two previous functions the prepare for segue function and the cell for row at those two together essentially show us the username of the user in the cell and pass the data from one view controller to another but that does not neccesarily mean that they set the data therefore with this did select row is what it essentially does is when we tap on the cell that passes the data from one view controller to another we have to set the data in the next view controller so by this works in our benefit because we want to pass the usernames of the users and set them in the next view controller as their username in the username label

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        // let cell = UITableViewCell(style: .subtitle, reuseIdentifier: cellID)
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "nearbyPeopleCell", for: indexPath)
        cell.textLabel?.text = hardCodedUsers[indexPath.row].username
   //   username = hardCodedUsers[indexPath.row].username
        
        // So essentially what we are doing here is that we are is assigning the value of the cells that display the usernames of the other users to the variable username we declared at the top of the class and why we are doing this is becauase we want the username to be displaying the usernames of the users from firebase but still we have to pass that data over to the profile view controller and we know to do this we have to use the prepare for segue function
        // Set cell contents
        return cell
        
    }
    
    
    // So the problem we are essentially having is that we are stacking the views on the one profile view controller but when we get the second one that is the correct one so there is an error somewhere in the transition
    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
        
        if let identifier = segue.identifier {
            if identifier == "toProfile" {
                let profileViewController = segue.destination as? ProfileViewController
                //  So essentially we know that the username we gave declared earlier now contains the usernames of the users from firebase but yet we have to pass that on to the next view controller thats why we are in this function therefore we have to finda way to pass that data over
                //   print(username)
                print(profileViewController?.username)
                
                // So when we print this we are getting nil meaning nothing was assigned to it yet therefore we want to assign the cells usernames which we are doing in the lines of codes below
                // And why would weassign the label text to username that is essentially hard coding the label text for each cell that we tap on
                profileViewController?.username = username
                
                
                //profileViewController?.usernameLabel.text = username
                // we can not do this line of code above because we know that if we store the usernames within this username label.text variable only one username will get stored and thats what causes it to appear on every username when each cell is tapped
                
                
            }
